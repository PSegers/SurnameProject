Calculates how much surnames go extinct over a certain period of time.
Takes into consideration the arguments listed below.

Keyword arguments:
population(int) -- population of a certain group of individuals
classes(int) -- how this population is classified evenly (surnames)
gen_amount(int) -- how many generations will pass (every generation is approximately 20-30 years)
birthrate(int) -- birthrate of children in integer percentages
sim_runs(int) -- how many times the simulation is ran
    
NOTES:
    * Most console prints disabled

TODO:
    * Add exceptions
